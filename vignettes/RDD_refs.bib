  abstract = {In Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs for evaluating causal effects
	of interventions, assignment to a treatment is determined at least
	partly by the value of an observed covariate lying on either side
	of a fixed threshold. These designs were first introduced in the
	evaluation literature by Thistlewaite and Campbell (1960). With the
	exception of a few unpublished theoretical papers, these methods
	did not attract much attention in the economics literature until
	recently. Starting in the late 1990s, there has been a large number
	of studies in economics applying and extending RD methods. In this
	paper we review some of the practical and theoretical issues involved
	in the implementation of RD methods.<P>(This abstract was borrowed
	from another version of this item.)},
